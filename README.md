## How it works

Each open tile is a hyperlink embedded in an image which tracks the number of clicks and redirects you to back my profile.
Every time the program is run it plays the move with maximum number of clicks.
It uses GitHub Actions to run every hour using a cron job.
The rest is just a regular game of Tic-Tac-Toe
    
## About Me

Hey there! 👋 My name is Kavish Hukmani, and I'm a passionate 🥇, creative 🎨, and perceptive 🔭 engineer 🔧 with a hands-on approach to problem-solving and an unending thirst for knowledge 📚. Anything and everything that can be classified as technology 💻 fascinates me.

Currently, I'm based in the beautiful city of San Francisco 🌉 where I work as an Analytics Professional 📊 at Meta, using GenAI to parse feedback on facilities 🏢 and culinary services 🍽️ for over 100k employees and contractors worldwide. Previously, I was a Data Scientist 🧑‍🔬 at Unison, focusing on challenges in Finance 💰, Housing 🏠, and Marketing 📣. Before that, I contributed to the Impact Analytics team, developing products that facilitated data-driven decision-making for leading Retail 💃 and CPG 🍫 companies. Oh, and I proudly hold an MS in Business Analytics 📈 from UC Davis 🎓.

When I'm not immersed in the world of technology, you can find me following a range of sports, from Soccer ⚽ and Formula1 🏎️ to various eSports 🖱️. Apart from that, I love solving puzzles 🧩 and listening to music 🎶.

I'm always open to new ideas and opportunities. You can learn more about me on my [website](https://kavi.sh/) 🌐 or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kavish-hukmani/) 👥. Feel free to reach out to me directly at [khukmani@gmail.com](mailto:khukmani@gmail.com) 📧. Let's connect and explore exciting possibilities together! 🚀
